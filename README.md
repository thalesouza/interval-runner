# Interval Runner
This will be an web application for my personal use of intervals running workouts.

If someone sees it could use too we can make some mobile app for this.

My intention to build this project was because I never found a interval workout app that really suits me
So, since I learned to code, why not develop one?

My idea here is to use the below technologies:
- Typescript
- NestJs
- Jest
- GraphQL
